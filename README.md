# ALCMC
We are using deep-al/pycls/al/typiclust.py 

We are trying to make typiclust.py  work for us in the code we got from the TA. 

Then:
We are working on 3 different clustering methods
1# K-means Clustering
2# Hierarchical Clustering
3# DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
